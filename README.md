# Elpe Efpe

A simple Lebenspunkte (Elpe) and Fokuspunkte (Efpe) calculator app for the Pen and Paper RPG system Splittermond.

Currently this is a WinJS (!) UWP (that is Universal Windows Platform :D) App.
Testbed to finally do something with redux.

Should be easy to port to Android and iOS using react native.

Currently especially the persistence is quick and dirty. Documentation is nonexistent. A weekend hack.

## Run it

```
npm install -g webpack-dev-server
npm install
webpack-dev-server
```
